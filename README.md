Over the past year, countless narratives have dominated public conversation leading to countless squabbles on social media platforms, while ignoring the question of where these narratives originate from. The power of controlling narratives has shifted from journalism stalwarts to tech companies, but the centralized ethos remains where the power to dictate the narrative lies in the enfranchised few. 

StoryHat ushers in a new era of decentralized storytelling, that is especially promising as an education platform designed to encourage creative collaboration. 

Open to everybody and censoring nobody, the platform allows any author to contribute to a storyline generated by others or even create their own stories. The web application will live on an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain making contributing to or creating stories affordable and fast. 

The app will serve two primary purposes: 

1. Serve a library of decentralized content generated by a diverse group of authors.
2. Provide a marketplace for publishing and selling works, ensuring full ownership to authors. 
This addresses the problems with media today in the barrier to entry for unknown authors, as well as the openness that a decentralized platform brings. The goal of this project is to introduce people to the world of web3 as well as spark the creative imaginations of people in an atmosphere of collaboration.
